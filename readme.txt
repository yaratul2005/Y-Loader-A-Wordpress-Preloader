A simple yet powerful plugin to add a customizable preloader to your entire WordPress website.

== Description ==

Awesome Preloader provides an easy way to add a loading screen that appears while your site's content is loading in the background. This improves user experience by providing visual feedback. You can customize the preloader with different CSS animations, a custom image (like a logo GIF), or simple text. You can also change the background color to match your site's branding.

**Features:**

* Site-wide preloader enabled by default.
* Choose between 3 pure CSS animations (Spinner, Dots, Pulse).
* Upload a custom image or GIF to use as a loading icon.
* Display custom text.
* Customize background and text colors.
* Lightweight and performance-focused.

== Installation ==

1.  Upload the `awesome-preloader` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2.  Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3.  Go to `Settings > Awesome Preloader` to configure the options.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I disable the preloader on a specific page? =

This version does not support per-page disabling. The preloader is active site-wide.

= What kind of image should I use? =

For best results, use a small, optimized image. A transparent GIF or an SVG file is highly recommended for animations.
